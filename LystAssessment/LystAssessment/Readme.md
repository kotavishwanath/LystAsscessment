My Approach:
- After successful build of the app, first screen will show list of all cat images and its name, I have used collection view for this.
- When clicking on any of the cat image, it navigates to detailed screen where I am using the cat image, temperament, energylevels and also Wiki Url
- I have used MVVM architecture
- I have sepearted all the views part, logic part, network calls and URL constants
- This project will support version iOS 14 and above 
- I have used Swift 5

Current Limitations:
- If I get some more time I can will be able to create test cases for API
- As of now I have fixed the collection view cell width but in future, I will set the width depends on the device width
- I also need to test the performace of the application like the loading time of images 
- I havent tested it on device, need to check the user experience.
- We can also impove the UI by setting the loading indicator on each cell and remove it once the image has been downloaded also few other UI improments can be made with respect to cat image
